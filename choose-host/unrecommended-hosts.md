# Unrecommended Hosts

{% hint style="warning" %} The Modmail team does not in any way intend to defame, harm, or otherwise create badwill betweeen Modmail and the open source community as a whole, and any hosting provider. We simply provide this list to our users through our experience. We do not in any way imply that these hosts are bad, unreliable, or that it is not possible to use them, we simply state that these are not a good fit for hosting Modmail. {% endhint %}

### Repl.it

- [Website](https://repl.it)
- Repl.it is a provider aimed at hosting websites. Meaning, it does not have the proper tools and features to properly host the Modmail bot.
- This host is particularly problematic, and there have been many documented unexplainable issues that occur when hosting your bot with this method. Because of this, it is **strongly discouraged** for use.


### Bot-hosting.net

- [Website](https://bot-hosting.net/)
- bot-hosting.net is a free or low cost hosting provider that bases their hosting platform on the common free and open-source panel [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/).
- Hosting on any Pterodactyl panel based host is already challenging, however, bot-hosting.net shares IP addressess amoung users, which has resulted in high numbers of our users reporting rate limits being applied to their bot. In other words: your bot will randomly stop working with nothing you can do to resolve it.


### Pylex Nodes

- [Website](https://pylexnodes.net/)
- Same conditions and issues as above.

## Karlo Hosting
- [Website](https://karlo-hosting.com/)
- Another free or low cost hosting provider based on the Pterodactyl panel, our users have reported unusual difficulties deploying Modmail with this host due to their specific Pterodactyl configuration and limitations.
