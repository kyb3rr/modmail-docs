# Updating

## Updating Modmail

You can update Modmail on your Heroku account whenever changes are made to the repository. If you want to update while hosting locally (not Heroku), simply type `git pull` in your terminal and install the requirements again with `pipenv install`.

## Forking the repo

Before you get started, you must [fork](https://github.com/modmail-dev/modmail/fork) the repo first if you are using Heroku and want to update the bot.

### Syncing a fork branch from the web UI

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the forked repository that you want to sync with the upstream repository.
2.  Select the Sync fork dropdown.

3.  Then click Update branch.

If the changes from the upstream repository cause conflicts, GitHub will prompt you to create a pull request to resolve the conflicts.

### I want to enable automatic updates

1. Create a GitHub account
2. [Fork](https://github.com/modmail-dev/modmail/fork) the repository
3. Add GITHUB\_TOKEN into your configuration variables from https://github.com/settings/tokens with the repo scope ([Guide](https://github.com/modmail-dev/modmail/wiki/Installation-\(cont.\)#4-how-to-obtain-your-github\_token---required-for-the-update-command-)).
4. Link your GitHub account to heroku ![](https://i.imgur.com/qjWraS0.png)
5. Turn on automatic deploys ![](https://i.imgur.com/jgUVl7f.png)
6. Restart the bot

### I want to update the bot once

[Click here to create a new pull request to your fork](https://github.com/modmail-dev/modmail/pull/new/master). Select `compare across forks`, make the base repository `yourusername/modmail` and ensure the branch is set to master. Put any title you want and create the pull request. On the page that comes after this, merge the pull request.

You then want to go to your modmail application in Heroku, connect your modmail fork via the `Deploy` tab and deploy the `master` branch.

You can turn on auto-deploy for the master branch if you don't want to go through the process of logging into Heroku and deploying the branch every time changes to the repo are made in the future. However, you will have to make a pull request to update your fork every time.
