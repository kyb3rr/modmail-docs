# Introduction

Modmail is a self-hosted Discord bot for your server. It works similar to [Reddit](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210896606-What-is-Modmail-)'s Modmailâ€”both in functionality and purpose. It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users in a seamless way.

This bot is free for everyone and always will be. If you like this project and would like to show your appreciation, you can support us on [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/kyber), cool benefits included!

## What is Modmail used for?

When a member sends a direct message to Modmail, the bot will create a channel (we call it a "thread") into a designated category. All further DM messages will automatically relay to that channel, then any available staff can respond within the channel. Compared to ticketing bots, Modmail allows easier and more organised discussions among staff. &#x20;

Our Logviewer will save the threads so your staff can view previous threads through their corresponding log link. ~~Here is an~~ [~~**example**~~](https://publicmodmail.logs.vodka/logs/example).

{% hint style="info" %} In this guide when we refer to bot commands, we will assume the prefix to be `?` and will display them like in this example. `?help`. Optional arguments will be in [brackets], for example `?close [time] [reason] [silently].` Required arguments will be put in <andled brackets>, for example `?permissions add <command/level> <name> <user/role>` {% endhint %}
