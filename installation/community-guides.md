## [Replit Guide](https://gist.github.com/anondev-sudo/24978429b85b44348bcff5c0885afe82) by AnonDev

An online code execution environment. You can host Modmail there for free using certain exploits. The legitimate method costs $7 USD per month. However, regardless if you pay or host for free, hosting on Replit are often unstable and thus not recommended. But for now, this is the only option for those without a payment method for hosting or verification.

## [Northflank](https://blog.project-mei.xyz/2023/04/11/hosting-discord-modmail-on-northflank/) Guide by raidensakura

Northflank is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Railway that offers abilities to run micro-services like bots, schedule jobs that run periodically and databases with a powerful UI, API and CLI. Their panel is a bit more advanced as compared to Railway but comes with the perk of more customization and features. You will need a valid payment method to verify your account, but will unlock a free tier project that's separated from paid resources. They will not charge your card if you go over resource usage as you have limited allocation per service.
